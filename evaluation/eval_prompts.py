COMPREHENSIVENESS_PROMPT ="""You are tasked with evaluating the comprehensiveness of two answers to a scientific question. Comprehensiveness is defined as how much detail the answer provides to cover all aspects and details of the question.

Here is the question:
<question>
{QUESTION}
</question>

Here is the answer generated by the Graph RAG system:
<graph_rag_answer>
{GRAPH_RAG_ANSWER}
</graph_rag_answer>

Here is the answer generated by the Chat LLM model:
<chat_llm_answer>
{CHAT_LLM_ANSWER}
</chat_llm_answer>

Carefully analyze both answers, focusing on their comprehensiveness. Consider the following:
1. How thoroughly does each answer address all aspects of the question?
2. Which answer provides more relevant details and explanations?
3. Does either answer miss any important points related to the question?

Based on your analysis, choose the answer that demonstrates better comprehensiveness. Provide a brief explanation for your choice, highlighting the key factors that made the chosen answer more comprehensive.

Present your evaluation in the following format:
<evaluation>
<reasoning>
[Your explanation for why the chosen answer is more comprehensive]
</reasoning>
<choice>
[State which answer is more comprehensive: "Graph RAG" or "Chat LLM"]
</choice>
</evaluation>

DIVERSITY_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating the diversity of answers to scientific questions. You will be given a question and two answers: one generated by a graph RAG system and another by a chat LLM model. Your job is to determine which answer demonstrates greater diversity and provide a brief explanation for your choice.

Here is the question:
<question>
{QUESTION}
</question>

Here are the two answers:

Graph RAG System Answer:
<graph_rag_answer>
{GRAPH_RAG_ANSWER}
</graph_rag_answer>

Chat LLM Model Answer:
<chat_llm_answer>
{CHAT_LLM_ANSWER}
</chat_llm_answer>

For this task, diversity is defined as how varied and rich the answer is in providing different perspectives and insights on the question. A diverse answer might include multiple viewpoints, consider various aspects of the topic, or explore different implications or applications of the concept.

Carefully read and analyze both answers, paying attention to:
1. The range of perspectives or approaches presented
2. The variety of examples or applications mentioned
3. The depth and breadth of insights provided
4. The consideration of different aspects or dimensions of the topic

After your analysis, determine which answer demonstrates greater diversity based on these criteria. Provide a brief explanation for your choice, highlighting specific elements that contribute to its diversity.

Present your evaluation in the following format:
<evaluation>
<reasoning>
[Your explanation for why the chosen answer is more diverse]
</reasoning>
<choice>
[State which answer is more diverse: "Graph RAG" or "Chat LLM"]
</choice>
</evaluation>

Ensure your reasoning is clear and specific, referencing particular aspects of the chosen answer that demonstrate its superior diversity.
"""

EMPOWERMENT_PROMPT = """You are tasked with evaluating the potential of using a graph RAG system for scientific question answering compared to a normal chat model. Your role is to act as a judge and determine which of two given answers better demonstrates empowerment.

Empowerment is defined as: How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed judgments about the topic?

Here is the question that was asked:
<question>
{QUESTION}
</question>

Here is the answer generated by the Graph RAG system:
<graph_rag_answer>
{GRAPH_RAG_ANSWER}
</graph_rag_answer>

Here is the answer generated by the Chat LLM model:
<chat_llm_answer>
{CHAT_LLM_ANSWER}
</chat_llm_answer>

To evaluate the empowerment of these two answers:

1. Carefully read and analyze both answers.
2. Consider how well each answer helps the reader understand the topic.
3. Assess how effectively each answer enables the reader to make informed judgments about the topic.
4. Compare the two answers based on their empowerment potential.

After your evaluation, provide your reasoning and final judgment. Your response should include:

1. A brief explanation of why you believe one answer demonstrates better empowerment than the other.
2. Your final judgment on which answer is better in terms of empowerment.

Present your evaluation in the following format:
<evaluation>
<reasoning>
[Your explanation for why the chosen answer is better]
</reasoning>
<choice>
[State which answer is more empowerment for user: "Graph RAG" or "Chat LLM"]
</choice>
</evaluation>
"""

DIRECTNESS_PROMPT = """You are tasked with evaluating the directness of two answers to a scientific question. Directness refers to how specifically and clearly an answer addresses the question at hand. Your goal is to determine which of the two answers - one generated by a Graph RAG system and one by a Chat LLM model - is more direct in addressing the given question.

Here is the scientific question:
<question>
{QUESTION}
</question>

Here is the answer generated by the Graph RAG system:
<graph_rag_answer>
{GRAPH_RAG_ANSWER}
</graph_rag_answer>

Here is the answer generated by the Chat LLM model:
<chat_llm_answer>
{CHAT_LLM_ANSWER}
</chat_llm_answer>

Please evaluate both answers based on their directness. Consider the following:
1. How specifically does each answer address the question?
2. How clearly is the information presented?
3. Is there any irrelevant information that doesn't contribute to answering the question?
4. Does the answer provide a straightforward response without unnecessary elaboration?

After careful consideration, choose the answer that you believe is more direct in addressing the question. Provide a brief explanation for your choice, highlighting the key factors that influenced your decision.


Present your evaluation in the following format:
<evaluation>
<reasoning>
[Your explanation for why the chosen answer is more direct]
