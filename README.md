## Overview

The GraphRAG project is a data pipeline and transformation suite that is designed to extract meaningful, structured data from unstructured text using the power of LLMs.

To learn more about GraphRAG and how it can be used to enhance your LLM's ability to reason about your private data, please visit the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research Blog Post.</a>

## Instructions for GraphRAG

### Step 1: Set Up Your Directory

1. Open the **Terminal** application.
2. Navigate to the directory where you'd like to download the repository. Replace ```...``` with your preferred path:
   ```
   cd ...
   ```
   **Example:***
   ```
   cd /Users/xu/Downloads
   ```

### Step 2: Download the GraphRAG Repository

1. Copy and paste the following command into Terminal to download the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/xtxxxxxtx/graphrag.git
   ```
2. Enter the newly created ```graphrag``` directory:
   ```
   cd graphrag/
   ```
3. To ensure you always have the latest updates, run these commands whenever you use GraphRAG (Not necessary for the first time):
   ```
   git fetch
   git pull
   ```

### Step 3: Start the GraphRAG Environment

1. **Skip this installation** if you already have ```poetry``` installed. Otherwise, follow the steps below to install it using ```pipx```.

   **On MacOS:**
   ```
   brew install pipx
   pipx ensurepath
   ```
   **On Windows:**
   ```
   scoop install pipx
   pipx ensurepath
   ```
   > **Note:** For more information about ```pipx```, you can visit [the pipx documentation](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).
3. With ```pipx``` installed, you can now install ```poetry```:
   ```
   pipx install poetry
   ```
4. Run the following command to activate the required environment:
   ```
   poetry shell
   ```

### Step 4: Download Test Papers

1. Visit [the link](https://wustl.box.com/s/wvi9z297a90d6ymdn3swas4fzezwliia) and download the ```ragtest``` folder, which contains the six sample papers.
2. Place the ```ragtest``` folder inside the main ```graphrag``` folder.
   > **Note:** There is a secondary ```graphrag``` folder within the main one. Make sure to place ```ragtest``` inside the main graphrag folder.

### Step 5: Test a Query

1. Run the following command in Terminal, modifying the query text as needed:
   ```
   PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)" python ad_graphrag/query/__main__.py --root ragtest --method global "What is the main topic in these papers?"
   ```
   > **Note:** Feel free to change the query text within the quotation marks to test different questions.

## Quickstart

To get started with the GraphRAG system we recommend trying the [Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator) package. This provides a user-friendly end-to-end experience with Azure resources.

## Repository Guidance

This repository presents a methodology for using knowledge graph memory structures to enhance LLM outputs. Please note that the provided code serves as a demonstration and is not an officially supported Microsoft offering.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Warning: GraphRAG indexing can be an expensive operation, please read all of the documentation to understand the process and costs involved, and start small.*
